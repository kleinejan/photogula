Gphoto2
It's a powerfull library that enables a lot of functons.
When we do a `gphoto2 --list-all-config`
This is the output: https://github.com/kleinejan/Gphoto2Json/blob/master/gphoto2-config-input.log

Where we see 4 types:
RANGE: could be an html range element
RADIO/ MENU: would be a select menu in html
TEXT: plain text element

These are all the settings a user can pick to be part of the config.
So if the users "adds" the ISO to the config. From that point on that setting can be changed for DAY and Night.
